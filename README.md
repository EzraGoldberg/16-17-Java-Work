# 16-17-Java-Work
A collection of java programs written for my ICS4U class in high school

The programs I am most proud of here are JugGameAndInterface.java, BinarySearch.java, and GraphicsForScrabbleSolver.java (ScrabbleSolver/ScrabbleSolver/src/login/GraphicsForScrabbleSolver.java)

Note that GraphicsForScrabbleSolver.java requires JavaFX and was written using NetBeans IDE
